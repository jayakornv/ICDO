# Inverse Composition Discriminative Optimization (ICDO)

This repository contains the point cloud registration code from the ICDO paper which was published in CVPR2018.

## To run the demo
1. clone this repository
2. download "3D Object in Clutter Recognition and Segmentation" dataset (Complete models) from TUM's Computer Vision Group (https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/clutter)
3. put the 3D files in folder /data/synthetic
4. run the demo files
   1) demo_training.m for training ICDO model
   2) demo_registration.m for example registration
